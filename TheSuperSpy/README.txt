Special Rules:

The manual entry mode has code implemented, but currently is not used (only there for the purpose to show that an
attempt was made to create a manual entry mode, since it is not fully tested)

The "File Loading Mode" also doubles as a file saving mode. It simultaneously saves the encrypted text when the encrypt
button is pressed
